# Simple Landing Page 
Just a landing page built with HTML and CSS using Flexbox. A live preview: https://errolntetha.github.io/landingpage/

# Note
This landing does not have any functionality or navigation. It is also not mobile responsive. The website is created based on my computer at 1920 resolution. It might look weird on your computer with different resolution other than this, not to mention mobile viewing.
